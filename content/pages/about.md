I am a Senior Research Fellow at the [Information Security Group (ISG), Royal Holloway, University of London](https://isg.rhul.ac.uk). My current research focusses on the use and abuse of trusted execution environments (TEEs) and mobile and embedded systems security.

I am part of the EU Horizon 2020 EXFILES project, which unifies European intelligence and law enforcement agencies, the private sector, and academia. Its aim is to develop novel data extraction methods from modern mobile devices for forensics purposes, including ways of circumventing TEEs, full-disk encryption, and related mechanisms.

Before this, I was a Data Scientist at [Atom Bank](https://www.atombank.co.uk), the UK's first mobile bank, working in a small team building high-assurance ETL pipelines for Â£3bn+ savings and mortgage reporting. In addition, I was a Research Scientist at the [OneSpan](https://www.onespan.com) between 2018-2020, a NASDAQ-listed financial technology company in Cambridge, UK, focussing on secure machine learning for user authentication, KYC and fraud detection. I also worked as a Mobile Security Engineer at Samsung's R&D Institute, supporting Common Criteria evaluations of flagship smartphones.

I hold a Ph.D. in Information Security from [Royal Holloway, University of London](https://isg.rhul.ac.uk) and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Newcastle University](https://ncl.ac.uk).

My technical skills include:

* Trusted execution environments (TEEs), including ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX and the GlobalPlatform specifications.
* Commercial experience in product deployment; programming in Python, C, and Java; SQL (Postgres and SQLite); data analysis and machine learning libraries, inc. PyLab, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, and Keras; and Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
* Building data-driven systems for security and high assurance applications.

I'm also the co-founder and lead [Tensorcrypt](https://tensor.software), a start-up that uses TEEs for high throughput secure enterprise data sharing in demanding environments.
